    Please follow these instructions carefully. I want a professional website for my software development company that looks and behaves exactly like https://conciergelite.fr in terms of layout, style, and background video effect.

üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

    Use React + TailwindCSS

    I will host the site on Netlify

    Video and images will be hosted externally ‚Äî I will provide the video file

    Make the site SEO-optimized for Google search rankings

    Code must be clean, responsive, and lightweight

‚úÖ DESIGN & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Hero Section (Top)

    Same layout and structure as https://conciergelite.fr

    Background video must autoplay, loop, and be muted

    I will provide the video file

    Overlay text should include:

        My company name: DropTechify

        Tagline: ‚ÄúWe Build Digital Solutions That Build Your Brand‚Äù (can be updated)

2. Scrolling Services Section (Below the video)

    Same style as ConciergeLite ‚Äî with services scrolling horizontally below the hero video

    My services (animated or scrolling list):

        Website Development

        WordPress Development

        Video Editing

        Guest Posting

        App Development

3. About Section

    Simple, clean, 2-column layout with:

        Company intro

        Brief description of mission/vision

        Image on one side (optional)

4. Services Section

    This should have a different visual style than ConciergeLite

    Each service should be in its own card/block with icon, title, and short description

    Clean and minimal, responsive design

5. FAQ Section

    Add 4‚Äì6 dummy questions and answers

    Use collapsible accordions or clean toggles

6. Privacy Policy

    Add a placeholder privacy policy page or section

    Include basic info for compliance

7. Contact Section

    Leave a placeholder ‚Äî I will add it myself later

üìà SEO REQUIREMENTS:

    Add meaningful meta tags (title, description, OG tags)

    Add robots.txt and sitemap.xml (for Netlify SEO)

    Ensure site is mobile-first responsive

    Optimize all images and videos for fast load

    Use <h1>, <h2> etc. correctly for structure

    Ensure clean URLs and semantic HTML

üìù ADDITIONAL NOTES:

    I will provide the background video file separately

    The site should look identical to https://conciergelite.fr in layout and transitions, but with my own content and services

    Keep all text and content easy to update

    All animations should be smooth and lightweight

Once done, I will connect the custom domain and Firebase myself if needed.

Thank you ‚Äî please do not make design or structure changes on your own. Follow the above exactly.
